## Socioeconomic Determinants of Healthcare Accessibility
This project examines the impact of socioeconomic factors on healthcare accessibility in the U.S., with a focus on health insurance coverage for adults aged 26 to 34 and 35 to 49.


## Airline Sentiment Analysis
This project is based on US airline sentiment analysis, aimed at identifying key factors affecting customer satisfaction. We analyze Twitter data to uncover sentiment trends using NLP and unsupervised machine learning. Through K-means clustering and topic modeling on around 14,600 tweets, we quantify public sentiment about airlines, seeking ways to improve customer experiences despite cost-cutting measures in the industry.
